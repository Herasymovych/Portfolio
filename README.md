# Portfolio

Hello everyone. my name is Oleksandra. I have more then 10 years experience in sales, but last years I am keen on quality assurance. Now I still study a lot in this subject, and automatization  - is cherry on my cake :)
So I hope this portfolio will be constantly updated with my achievements and new skills. And finally I will start my career in my very first IT-company.
